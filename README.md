# SidGautam
If I am being honest, I don't really know what this is anymore. <br>
It was supposed to be my own custom programming language. <br>
At the moment, however, it is **MANY** things, but the only ones I've posted here are the **JavaScript Library, AI Chat Assistant, and Notepad** Variants.

Most of which is deployed at [sidgautam.ca](https://www.sidgautam.ca/)
