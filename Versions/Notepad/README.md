# SidGautamNotes

This is SidGautamNotes...

I honestly dont remember why I originally made this.<br>
The only thing I can think of is that I wanted an IDE for "SidGautam", except I never ended up making "SidGautam".
<br><br>

It is a simple text-editor with some basic functions. It also take screenshots of the text and saves the PNG in:
- JAR: Folder where JAR is being run.
- EXE and DEB: Downloads folder of user.

It was originally made in JavaFX, and required the JRE to run, but near the end of 2025, I remade the whole thing so it could run Natively in Windows and Linux.<br>

The original JRE JAR file is in the 'JavaCode' Folder in 'srcCode'.

Click the inconspicuous button below to go to my Google Drive, where you can download:
- Zip with the EXE Installer and SHA256 Hash.
- Zip with the Portable EXE Files.
- Zip with the .DEB File and SHA256 Hash.
