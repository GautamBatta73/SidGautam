# SidGautamScript Libraries

This folder contains information on the functions and variables that I packaged with the compiler and runtime environment, which are built-in libraries.

## How to import libraries

<br>
The following snippet imports the Math library.

```python
import "Math";
```

The same applies to all built-in libraries, but replace 'Math' with the name of the library.


## Libraries

1. **[Math](./math.md)**: Has the basic math functions one may need.

2. **[ObjectUtils](./objutils.md)**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Objects.

3. **[ListUtils](./listutils.md)**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Lists.

4. **[StringUtils](./strutils.md)**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Strings.
