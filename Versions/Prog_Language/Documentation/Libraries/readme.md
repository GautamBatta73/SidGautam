# SidGautamScript Libraries

This folder has information on the functions and variables, that I packaged with the compiler and runtime environment, as built in libraries.

## How to import libraries

<br>
The following snippet imports the Math library.

```python
import "Math";
```

The same goes for all the libraries, but replace 'Math' with the name of the library.


## Libraries

1. **Math**: Has the basic math functions one may need.

2. **ObjectUtils**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Objects.

3. **ListUtils**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Lists.

4. **StringUtils**: Has some extra helpful utilities for Strings.
