# SidGautamScript

This is SidGautamScript...

I honestly don't remember why I wanted to make this.<br>
I think the story went something like: <br>
I was using JQuery in my Web Programming Class, and I hated the syntax. So, I was like 'I'll make my own JS Library', and SidGautamJS was born. Then I decided to make one in Java, and SidGautamJava was born (never released). Then I guess I wanted to make my own programming language. I never actually thought I would do it, but after graduating in 2026 and being unable to find a job, I learned how and ended up writing the compiler in NodeJS.
<br><br>

It is a simple programming language with some basic functions. It can do your basic program stuff, and I even include built in libraries, like Math.

Currently, it only runs in Windows.<br>
- sgc.exe is the Compiler
- sg.exe is the Executor

### How To Run:
1. Write a .sidg source code file, or use a test file.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and type "{Path to sgc.exe} {Path to .sidg file}".
3. A compiled .sidgc file will be created.
4. Open the terminal/command prompt and type "{Path to sg.exe} {Path to .sidgc file}".
5. Unless you get an error, it should execute the script's code.

### Basic Tips:
- Pretty much anything you can do has been done in test1.sidg, test2.sidg, and test3.sidg (I use both for recursion testing).

- Zip with the Test Files, Compiler, and Executor (Runtime Environment) as EXE.
