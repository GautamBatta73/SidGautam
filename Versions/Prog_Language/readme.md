# SidGautamScript

This is SidGautamScript...

I honestly don't remember why I wanted to make this.<br>
I think the story went something like: <br>
I was using JQuery in my Web Programming Class, and I hated the syntax. So, I was like 'I'll make my own JS Library', and SidGautamJS was born. Then I decided to make one in Java, and SidGautamJava was born (never released). Then I guess I wanted to make my own programming language. I never actually thought I would do it, but after graduating in 2026 and being unable to find a job, I learned how and ended up writing the compiler in NodeJS.
<br><br>

It is a simple programming language with some basic functions. It can do your basic program stuff, and I even include built in libraries, like Math.

Currently, it only runs in Windows and Linux.<br>
- sgc is the Compiler
- sg is the Executor

### How To Run:
1. Write a .sidg source code file, or use a test file.
2. Open the terminal/command prompt and type "{Path to sgc executable} {Path to .sidg file}".
3. A compiled .sidgc file will be created.
4. Open the terminal/command prompt and type "{Path to sg executable} {Path to .sidgc file}".
5. Unless you get an error, it should execute the script's code.

### Basic Tips:
- Pretty much anything you can do has been done in test1.sidg, test2.sidg, and test3.sidg (I use both for recursion testing).

Click the inconspicuous button below to go to my Google Drive, where you can download:
- Zip with the Test Files, Compiler, and Executor (Runtime Environment) as EXEs.
- Zip with the Test Files, Compiler, and Executor (Runtime Environment) as Linux Executables.

**For Linux: Once downloaded, you may need to give execution permissions on the files to execute them properly**
