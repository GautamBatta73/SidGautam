# Uncomment this if you want to *always* run in debug mode. Otherwise,
# run the installer with the -d/--debug option to debug a single run.

#DEBUG="yes"



# Run all executable pre-install or post-install scripts found in
# /usr/lib/refractainstaller/pre-install   and
# /usr/lib/refractainstaller/post-install
# Change run_preinstall to "yes" to set locale and timezone during 
# installation, and set run_postinstall to "yes" to remove installer
# icon from desktop. (or edit those scripts.)
# These settings will be used for Simple Install and CLI installer.
# They also set the default in the Expert Install Options window, where
# they can be turned on or off at runtime.

# Separate partitions for selected directories
# If you want any directories other than /boot or /home on separate
# partitions, change this to "yes" and make sure run_postinstall is 
# also set to "yes". This only affects the cli installer.
# For the gui installer, check "Move selected directories..." in the
# expert options window (and check "Run post-install scripts.")
#
# You must create and format the extra partitions during the
# partitioning phase of the installation or before running the installer.
#
# At the end of the installation, you will be asked to select the 
# directories you want separate, and they will be copied to the selected
# partitions. The contents of the original directory on the root filesystem
# will then be deleted.

# If you pre-format the partitions, you can prevent the script from
# formatting again. Useful if you want other than ext2/3/4.
# Default is commented out.

#no_format="yes"



# The rsync_excludes file lists files and directories that will not
# be copied to the new system. If you use a custom excludes list, put
# the full path to that file here. Default is:

rsync_excludes="/usr/lib/refractainstaller/installer_exclude.list"



# If your installation includes separate /boot and/or /home partitions,
# and you need to exclude something in /boot or /home, you can edit the
# contents of this file, or you could change this to point to a custom
# file. Do not point this to $rsync_excludes!

# This comments out the line in /etc/pmount.allow which allows

# SSH Settings
# If ssh_pass="yes", then PasswordAuthentication will be set to "yes"
# If ssh_pass="no", then PasswordAuthentication will be set to "no"
# In either of the above cases, if PermitRootLogin was set to "yes",
# it will be changed to "prohibit-password" (meaning with auth keys only)
# If ssh_pass is null or set to anything other than "yes" or "no", then
# /etc/ssh/sshd_config will not be altered.

# UEFI ID
# grub-efi will use some magic to choose a name for the bootloader
# directory found in boot/efi/EFI/, such as debian, devuan or refracta. 
# If you want to specify a name, put it here by uncommenting the line
# and replacing newinstall with the new name.

# Default is commented out.

# UEFI Removable Media Path
# Uncomment to force installation to the removable media path also.
# This option is only available on EFI.
# Default is commented out.
