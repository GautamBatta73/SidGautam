# /etc/login.defs - Configuration control definitions for the shadow package.
#

# REQUIRED for useradd/userdel/usermod
#   Directory where mailboxes reside, _or_ name of file, relative to the
#   home directory.  If you _do_ define MAIL_DIR and MAIL_FILE,
#   MAIL_DIR takes precedence.
#
#   Essentially:
#      - MAIL_DIR defines the location of users mail spool files
#        (for mbox use) by appending the username to MAIL_DIR as defined
#        below.
#      - MAIL_FILE defines the location of the users mail spool files as the
#        fully-qualified filename obtained by prepending the user home
#        directory before $MAIL_FILE
#
# NOTE: This is no more used for setting up users MAIL environment variable
#       which is, starting from shadow 4.0.12-1 in Debian, entirely the
#       job of the pam_mail PAM modules
#       See default PAM configuration files provided for
#       login, su, etc.
#
# This is a temporary situation: setting these variables will soon
# move to /etc/default/useradd and the variables will then be
# no more supported
MAIL_DIR        /var/mail
#MAIL_FILE      .mail

#
# Enable display of unknown usernames when login(1) failures are recorded.

#TTYTYPE_FILE	/etc/ttytype

#
# If defined, file which inhibits all the usual chatter during the login
# sequence.  If a full pathname, then hushed mode will be enabled if the

# Max number of login(1) retries if password is bad
# This will most likely be overriden by PAM, since the default pam_unix module

LOGIN_RETRIES		5

# Which fields may be changed by regular users using chfn(1) - use

# If set to MD5, MD5-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password

# If set to YESCRYPT, YESCRYPT-based algorithm will be used for encrypting password

DEFAULT_HOME	yes

#
# The pwck(8) utility emits a warning for any system account with a home

#USERDEL_CMD	/usr/sbin/userdel_local

#
# If set to yes, userdel(8) will remove the user's group if it contains no more
# members, and useradd(8) will create by default a group with the name of the
# user.
#
# Other former uses of this variable are not used in PAM environments, such as
