Refracta GNU/Linux is based on Devuan GNU/Linux (Jessie) and 
uses Devuan repositories for packages. This is a live-CD. You can run
the software by booting from the CD, and it won't touch your hard drive.

Refracta provides a fully functional desktop environment with word
processor, photo editor, multimedia software and more.

Refracta contains many programs for diagnostics, rescue and repair.

You can install Refracta to the hard drive and configure it the way you 
want, and then create your own live-CD by running Refracta Snapshot.
